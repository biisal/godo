This involves configuring environment variables, deploying the latest backend build, syncing the PostgreSQL schema with production, and setting up logging with Sentry. The domain staging.example.com should be protected via basic HTTP auth.\n\nEnsure CORS settings allow frontend access. Integrate feature toggles for the staging-specific builds using the internal feature flag system. Also verify SSL certs are renewed automatically and logs are stored for at least 30 days. Finally, provide a secure link to the internal team with credentials to access the staging dashboard.","done":false},{"id":9,"title":"build modular notification system","description":"Design and implement a fully modular, scalable notification system that handles multi-channel delivery (email, SMS, push, and in-app messages). The system should respect user-defined preferences, DND schedules, and localization settings. \n\nStart by defining a clean event-publishing interface that other services can use. Use Redis or a message broker like NATS for internal event distribution. Develop a microservice to consume events, apply business rules (priority, channel fallback, retry policies), and deliver messages accordingly. The delivery workers should be stateless and scalable. \n\nDevelop a flexible template engine with support for placeholders, multiple languages, and themes (dark mode, mobile friendly). Implement admin interfaces to manage templates, preview messages, and monitor bounce/delivery stats. Integrate with SendGrid for email, Twilio for SMS, and Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications. \n\nEnsure GDPR compliance: provide easy opt-out links, store consents, and audit delivery history. Add a dashboard to track notification metrics, queue status, and latency.\n\nPerformance test the entire system under high concurrency with various channel loads. Simulate partial outages and measure failover behavior. Provide detailed logs and monitoring alerts for delivery failures. Ensure new channels like WhatsApp or Slack can be added via plug-in modules without major refactoring.","done":true},{"id":10,"title":"write internal dev onboarding doc","description":"Create a comprehensive onboarding document for new backend developers joining the team. This should cover:\n\n1. Project architecture overview (API gateway, services, data layer).\n2. How to set up the dev environment using Docker Compose or Nix.\n3. Overview of key tools: Postgres, Redis, Celery, RabbitMQ, Prometheus.\n4. Code structure and naming conventions.\n5. Authentication system, role-based access control, and token rotation.\n6. How to use the internal CLI tool for managing migrations and tasks.\n7. Environment management: .env files, secrets, vault usage.\n8. Recommended IDE setup (VS Code + extensions or Neovim config).\n9. Testing strategies: unit tests with pytest, integration tests, mocks.\n10. Deployment overview: CI/CD via GitHub Actions, staging vs prod pipelines.\n11. Logging and debugging tools.\n12. List of must-read internal tools, Slack channels, Confluence pages.\n13. Common mistakes and how to avoid them.\n\nUse real examples and code snippets where possible. Keep it concise but detailed enough that a new hire can become productive within 3–5 days. Get it reviewed by at least 2 current team members before publishing.","done":true},{"id":11,"title":"optimize product listing page","description":"The current product listing page takes over 3 seconds to load due to large image payloads and repeated API calls. Optimize the backend API to support pagination, filtering by category and price, and response caching with Redis.\n\nOn the frontend, lazy-load images using Intersection Observer and compress thumbnails using WebP. Preload category filters on page load to minimize latency. Combine multiple product fetches into a single batched API call.\n\nRun Lighthouse audits and aim for 90+ performance score. Measure Time to First Byte (TTFB) and reduce it under 200ms by tuning server response times and CDN caching. Consider edge caching static content with Cloudflare.","done":false},{"id":12,"title":"migrate analytics to new platform","description":"We’re moving from our legacy analytics system to a new provider (e.g., Plausible or Mixpanel).\n\nTasks include: auditing all existing event tracking in the frontend and backend, mapping them to new equivalents, setting up event schemas, updating environment keys, and verifying GDPR compliance. Create a test dashboard to compare both platforms side by side for 2 weeks before fully switching.\n\nEnsure all dashboards and reports (weekly active users, conversion rate, retention) are ported correctly. Provide a migration checklist and fallback plan.","done":false},{"id":13,"title":"user feedback loop","description":"Build a feedback system into the product where users can submit ratings, bug reports, and suggestions.\n\nBack this with a Postgres schema for feedback, optional screenshots, and timestamps.

Use a middleware chain (or decorator pattern) where each unit is testable. Split rate-limiting logic into its own file. Inject user roles into context, not request directly. Add integration tests with mocked auth tokens.","done":false},{"id":15,"title":"research ai-assisted ui generation","description":"Explore how tools like GPT-4, GPT-Engineer, or Uizard can auto-generate frontend code or component trees from simple text prompts.

It must comply with industry security standards such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and GDPR data privacy regulations.\n\nInventory control will track stock levels in real-time, handle replenishment workflows, and support multi-warehouse logistics. It should include support for batch tracking, expiry management, and automated alerts for low stock.\n\nOrder processing requires robust workflow management, including order validation, payment processing through multiple gateways, shipment tracking, and returns handling. The module will interact closely with inventory and customer management services.\n\nAnalytics and reporting will offer real-time dashboards, ad-hoc reporting tools, and scheduled reports. Data will be aggregated from all modules with support for custom KPIs, export to CSV/PDF, and integration with BI tools.\n\nThird-party integrations include APIs for CRM systems, ERP solutions, payment gateways, and shipping providers.
